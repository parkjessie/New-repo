## Collaboration means working together: 
* Two or more people
* Same goal or purpose
## We collaborate to develop skills to:
* Develop future future careers
* Create better computing innovations
* Avoid bias in computing innovations
* And more!
## Bias in Computing
* “Racist Algorithms Are Especially Dangerous for Teens”

# IOC-1: University Faculty Lecture by Owen Astrachan
## Computing and Computer Science
### Computing and Computer Science are changing our world
* This is true in every country, in every state, everywhere
### Change is accelerating: computing is faster, cheaper, bigger
* More due to cloud computing than parallel/distributed
### I will take a view centered in the United States
* 96% of AP exams administered in US, growing outside US
## Access to Computing and More
* Who has a computer?
* Who has access to the internet?
* Who is affected by computing
## Computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale
* Is not limited to programming
* Not limited to science, technology, engineering, math
## Smartphones and the Internet
* Roughly 276 million smartphone users in the United States
* Roughly 332 million people in the United States
* Roughly 60 million under 15
## What is poverty in the US?
* 12 million children, 16% of children live in poverty
* Different by region, race, ethnicity, and more
* In a family of four with two children, roughly $26,500/year
* % is growing due to Covid-19, had been improving
## Price/access of Internet
* In North America, $61/month average
* Atlanta $105, mLos Angeles $49, Washington DC, $71
* Roughly 75% of adults have broadband access at home
* Differs by age-range, fewer over 65 than 25
## How important is the Internet?
### Covid-19 exposes why access to the internet is a human right
* Covid-19 has exposed the underlying reality that not everyone has the internet at home.
## Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Innovation
### Benefit
* Delta expands optional facial recognition boarding to new airports, more customers
### Harmful
* Google has suspended its controversial ‘field research’ that allegedly scanned homeless people

## TPT 5.5 Legal and Ethic Concerns 
* **IP (Intellectual Property)**: a work on invention that is the result of creaticity to which one has rights
  * Eveything that we create can be IP; inventions, literary works, designs, images, etc.
* **Copyright**: protects your IP and keeps anyone from using it, unless you give them your permission
  > * **Plagiarism**: presenting material as your own
* **Creative Commons**: provides free liicenses that you can use to tell others how you want them to use your creations
  * Clearly tells others what they can and can't do with your IP
* **Open Source**: programs made freely availabe for anyone to use and may be redistributed and modified
  * Encourages open collaboration; make modifications and redistribute
* **Open Access**: online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
* **Digital Divide**: unequal distribution of access to technology

### When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
GitHub offers many licenses when you create a GitHub repository. Some examples include: Academic Free License, Apache License, Creative Commons License Family, MIT License, etc. All of these licenses have to do with computing and all fall under the topic of Legal and Ethical Concerns.

### Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
For both personal and Team project, I chose GNU license because it is the most reliable license and allows for most people to use it freely

## TPT 5.6 Safe Computing
* **PII (Personal Identifiable Information)**: any information that can be used to trace anyone's identity
  > * It can be used to cnhance a user's online experience
  > * It can be exploited if privacy and other protections are igonored
* Google, Facebook, and Twitter gather more information about behavior with their share, retweet, and like buttons they have embedded on the site
* **Authentication**: measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access
  > **Strong Passwords should contain**: 
     > * 10 ore more characters
     > * Must contain a symbol



# Week 1
## TPT 5.3 Computing Bias 
 * Computers sometimes can have bias in their funcion or algorithm
 * Mostly unintentional bias, but can cause serious problems for developers
 * Sometimes intentional/purposeful, such as advertising and voice recognition
 * Programmers/developers should take actions to reduce the bias used for computing innovations 
### Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? Justify your conclusion.
The owner of the computer does not think that this was intentional because he repeats that his blackness is causing the computer to not detect his face and therefore only takes it as a joke.  
### How do you think this happened?
 The computer camera is only programmed and trained to detect lighter skin color
### Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
 This is a harmful computing bias because even though the software is not created for an intended purpose, it only failed to detect people with dark skin.
### Should it be corrected?
 It should be corrected if the company that made this software don't want to be labeled as racist. 
### What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? 
 To produce a better outcome, you can collect the face datas from all around the world and let the software train with them.
## TPT 5.4 Crowdsourcing 
 * Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing
 * More crowdsourcing, the more you reduce Computer Bias
 > * Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing; can have inaccurate informations, but corrected through a self-policing community
 > * Crypto currency; all exchanges of money are valicated at least 3 times by independent miners this also reduces any bias that may be caused by a middle man, for example a bank which could inflict corruption
 > * RapidAPI; many programmers perform their tasks with tons of APIs created from other people
 > * GitHub; can create own repository, or fork and clone repositories from others; can also obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history
### CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
One example of crowdsourcing is a shared journal on Github. I would use this to allow others to obtain information on CS.
### What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
 Del Norte crowdsourcing can be a survey for DNHS students to input their responses about their mental health or academic workload. This could improve our final project by providing data and can be implmented for many reasons in our website.

### 5.2 Digital Divide
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
Demographics include, but not isolated to:
- Age
- Religion
In some countries:
- Computers are not that common in rural areas
- Only a small number of websites
- The internet is used to protect and advocate the government
- There is a high level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government
- Propaganda and dictarorships with strict regimes can inhibhit acess to the internet, thus causing digital divide
