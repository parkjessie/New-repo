## TPT 5.5 Legal and Ethic Concerns 
* **IP (Intellectual Property)**: a work on invention that is the result of creaticity to which one has rights
  * Eveything that we create can be IP; inventions, literary works, designs, images, etc.
* **Copyright**: protects your IP and keeps anyone from using it, unless you give them your permission
  > * **Plagiarism**: presenting material as your own
* **Creative Commons**: provides free liicenses that you can use to tell others how you want them to use your creations
  * Clearly tells others what they can and can't do with your IP
* **Open Source**: programs made freely availabe for anyone to use and may be redistributed and modified
  * Encourages open collaboration; make modifications and redistribute
* **Open Access**: online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
* **Digital Divide**: unequal distribution of access to technology

### When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
GitHub offers many licenses when you create a GitHub repository. Some examples include: Academic Free License, Apache License, Creative Commons License Family, MIT License, etc. All of these licenses have to do with computing and all fall under the topic of Legal and Ethical Concerns.

### Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
For both personal and Team project, I chose GNU license because it is the most reliable license and allows for most people to use it freely

## TPT 5.6 Safe Computing
* **PII (Personal Identifiable Information)**: any information that can be used to trace anyone's identity
  > * It can be used to cnhance a user's online experience
  > * It can be exploited if privacy and other protections are igonored
* Google, Facebook, and Twitter gather more information about behavior with their share, retweet, and like buttons they have embedded on the site
* **Authentication**: measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access
  > **Strong Passwords should contain**: 
     > * 10 ore more characters
     > * Must contain a symbol



# Week 1
## TPT 5.3 Computing Bias 
 * Computers sometimes can have bias in their funcion or algorithm
 * Mostly unintentional bias, but can cause serious problems for developers
 * Sometimes intentional/purposeful, such as advertising and voice recognition
 * Programmers/developers should take actions to reduce the bias used for computing innovations 
### Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? Justify your conclusion.
The owner of the computer does not think that this was intentional because he repeats that his blackness is causing the computer to not detect his face and therefore only takes it as a joke.  
### How do you think this happened?
 The computer camera is only programmed and trained to detect lighter skin color
### Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
 This is a harmful computing bias because even though the software is not created for an intended purpose, it only failed to detect people with dark skin.
### Should it be corrected?
 It should be corrected if the company that made this software don't want to be labeled as racist. 
### What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? 
 To produce a better outcome, you can collect the face datas from all around the world and let the software train with them.
## TPT 5.4 Crowdsourcing 
 * Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing
 * More crowdsourcing, the more you reduce Computer Bias
 > * Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing; can have inaccurate informations, but corrected through a self-policing community
 > * Crypto currency; all exchanges of money are valicated at least 3 times by independent miners
 > * RapidAPI; many programmers perform their tasks with tons of APIs created from other people
 > * GitHub; can create own repository, or fork and clone repositories from others; can also obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history
### CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
One example of crowdsourcing is a shared journal on Github. I would use this to allow others to obtain information on CS.
### What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
 Del Norte crowdsourcing can be a survey for DNHS students to input their responses about their mental health or academic workload. This could improve our final project by providing data and can be implmented for many reasons in our website.

## 5.1 & 5.2 CB Notes
### 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects
**Accelerometers**
- Automobile industry rove price down
- Used for airbag deployment and lateral movement detection

**Multirotor**
- Benefit - Deliveries, finding lost people, aerial photography is easy
- Harmful - flying in

**Wii Controller**
- Benefit - Gets people actively playing video games
- Harmful - Broken tvs and injuries

**3D Printers**
- Open-source software for the computer and printer
- In school and homes
- New classes developed for 3D printing
Special 3D printers can make:
- Organs/prosthetics
- Houses
- Shoes and jewelries
- Themselves
Advances in computers have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
### 5.2 Digital Divide
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
Demographics include, but not isolated to:
- Age
- Religion
In some countries:
- Computers are not that common in rural areas
- Only a small number of websites
- The internet is used to protect and advocate the government
- There is a high level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government
