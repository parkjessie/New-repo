## TPT 5.3 Computing Bias 
 * Computers sometimes can have bias in their funcion or algorithm
 * Mostly unintentional bias, but can cause serious problems for developers
 * Sometimes intentional/purposeful, such as advertising and voice recognition
 * Programmers/developers should take actions to reduce the bias used for computing innovations 
### Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? Justify your conclusion.
The owner of the computer does not think that this was intentional because he repeats that his blackness is causing the computer to not detect his face and therefore only takes it as a joke.  
### How do you think this happened?
 The computer camera is only programmed and trained to detect lighter skin color
### Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
 This is a harmful computing bias because even though the software is not created for an intended purpose, it only failed to detect people with dark skin.
### Should it be corrected?
 It should be corrected if the company that made this software don't want to be labeled as racist. 
### What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? 
 To produce a better outcome, you can collect the face datas from all around the world and let the software train with them.
## TPT 5.4 Crowdsourcing 
 * Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing
 * More crowdsourcing, the more you reduce Computer Bias
 > * Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing; can have inaccurate informations, but corrected through a self-policing community
 > * Crypto currency; all exchanges of money are valicated at least 3 times by independent miners
 > * RapidAPI; many programmers perform their tasks with tons of APIs created from other people
 > * GitHub; can create own repository, or fork and clone repositories from others; can also obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history
### CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
One example of crowdsourcing is a shared journal on Github. I would use this to allow others to obtain information on CS.
### What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
 Del Norte crowdsourcing can be a survey for DNHS students to input their responses about their mental health or academic workload. This could improve our final project by providing data and can be implmented for many reasons in our website.

## 5.1 & 5.2 CB Notes
### 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects
**Accelerometers**
- Automobile industry rove price down
- Used for airbag deployment and lateral movement detection

**Multirotor**
- Benefit - Deliveries, finding lost people, aerial photography is easy
- Harmful - flying in

**Wii Controller**
- Benefit - Gets people actively playing video games
- Harmful - Broken tvs and injuries

**3D Printers**
- Open-source software for the computer and printer
- In school and homes
- New classes developed for 3D printing
Special 3D printers can make:
- Organs/prosthetics
- Houses
- Shoes and jewelries
- Themselves
Advances in computers have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
### 5.2 Digital Divide
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
Demographics include, but not isolated to:
- Age
- Religion
In some countries:
- Computers are not that common in rural areas
- Only a small number of websites
- The internet is used to protect and advocate the government
- There is a high level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government
